        <h2>Mushroom Sisig from the Philippines</h2>
        <p>It's a vegan replacement for the renowned <strong>Filipino Pork Sisig</strong></p>
        <p>Sisig (SEE-sig) is traditionally made with chopped pig's face and served on a sizzling hot platter. 
            The mushrooms here mimic the chewy-meaty quality of pork and don't take nearly as long to prepare.
             You still get all the salty, tangy, and spicy flavors. And no face gets chopped!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 cloves Garlic</li>
            <li>2 Green onions</li>

            <li>1 cup Red onion</li>
